# `jssl` üîê
Fix Java SSL issues in seconds ‚Äì no more `PKIX path building failed`.  
`jssl` lets you **ping** and **install** SSL certs directly in your Java keystore.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmamico/java-ssl-tools/main/.doc/jssl.gif)

## üöÄ Install
any terminal:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmamico/java-ssl-tools/main/install.sh | bash
```
on Windows, use `Git Bash` as system administrator.  
  
üç∫  via homebrew:
```
brew install pmamico/java/jssl
```


## Manual
```
jssl <operation> [host|file] [options]
```
**Operations**  
- **ping**  
Check the SSL handshake against a host without modifying the keystore.  
- **install**  
Connect to a host, retrieve its SSL certificate, and install it into the Java keystore.  
- **file**  
Process a file containing a list of hosts (one per line) to ping or install certificates.  
- **list**  
List trusted certificates currently present in the Java keystore installed with jssl.  
- **uninstall**  
Remove a certificate from the Java keystore, identified by its alias.  
- **doctor**  
Read Maven or Gradle build logs (from stdin) and automatically detect and install missing certificates based on connection errors.  

## üê≥ Using jssl in docker

Here‚Äôs how you can use jssl inside a Dockerfile to import a certificate into the Java keystore during image build:

### üì¶ Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk

# Install dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl openssl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install jssl
RUN curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmamico/java-ssl-tools/main/install.sh | bash

# Set JAVA_HOME if not already set by base image
ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/openjdk

#  Add your cert at build time
RUN jssl example.com install

# Your application setup
COPY ./app.jar /app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

### üì¶ Docker Compose example (runtime install) 
If you have `jssl` in your base image, but you want to install the certificate at runtime, you can use the following Docker Compose setup:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      - JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/openjdk
    entrypoint: >
      sh -c "jssl example.xom install &&
             java -jar /app.jar"
```

## Why not just use `keytool`?
Java has a built-in `keytool` to handle certificates on the java keystore.  
However it has a few drawbacks:
### In `keytool` there is no way to check that the certifiacate works 
With `jssl` just type
```
$ jssl <URL> ping
```
### With `keytool` you have to type a lot!
 Especially annoying if you are in flow.  
First you need to get the certificate somehow,   
then to import it with keytool, thinking about alias names and the default password.  
Eg.:
```
$ echo | openssl s_client -connect "<URL>:443"  2>/dev/null | openssl x509 > certificate.pem
$ /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@11/bin/keytool -importcert -cacerts -noprompt -alias <myalias> -file certificate.pem -keypass changeit -storepass changeit
```
is equivalent to 
```
$ jssl <URL> install
```
